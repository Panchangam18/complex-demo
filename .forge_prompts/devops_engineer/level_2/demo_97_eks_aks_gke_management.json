  "task_description": "Implement unified management for EKS, AKS, and GKE clusters. Set up cluster autoscaling with mixed instance types, configure RBAC with consistent policies across clouds, implement pod security standards, enable cluster monitoring with cloud-native tools, set up automated backups with Velero, configure ingress controllers specific to each cloud, implement cost optimization with spot/preemptible instances, and establish unified logging with Fluentd to Elasticsearch.",
